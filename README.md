Data Cleaning: The data was initially cleaned and new columns were created.

Visualizations:
-Pie Chart: Success rates by type of attacks, target types, and types of attacks.

-Area Chart: Total attacks by year.
-Slicer: A slicer has been added for easier analysis of data by years, regions, and countries.
